UCF Orlando full time bootcamp, begun March 19 2018
# Psychic-Game, posted March 28, 2108

the game seems quite simple...guess the secret letter in 10 tries and win.

This is the "basic" assignment from UCF Bootcamp, due week #2 after only three (3) days of instruction in Javascript.
For such a simple game, a wealth of different instructions, commands & techniques must be employed... not to mention
learning all the bloody syntax and a number of one-off, unlikely-to-ever-be-used-again Javascript methods.

Initial post is the basic game.  Some additional CSS decorations may be added before the deadline.
